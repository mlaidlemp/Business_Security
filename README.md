# Business_Security
A fraud detection Machine Learning model trained on the Kaggle credit card dataset to enhance business security.

### Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using the Kaggle credit card fraud detection dataset. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the goal is to develop a model capable of identifying and classifying fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones.

### Goal & Motivation
With the growing volume of online financial transactions, identifying fraudulent activity has become an urgent task for businesses and financial institutions. This project aims to create an efficient and reliable fraud detection system using Random Forest and XGBoost models to enhance the security and integrity of credit card transactions. The key motivations for this project are:
- Accurate detection of fraudulent credit card transactions.
- Scalable machine learning solutions that can be deployed in real-world fraud detection systems.
- A foundation for AI-driven fraud prevention in the financial sector.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which contains anonymized transaction details labeled as either fraudulent (Class = 1) or legitimate (Class = 0). The dataset includes 30 anonymized features, making it ideal for building robust fraud detection models:
